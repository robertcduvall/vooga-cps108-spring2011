This project is designed to ease the creation, development, deployment, and playing of arcade-style 2D video games, often called casual games. Video games have many common characteristics that can be shared as a common design framework so that creating a new game requires only creating things specific to it. Common aspects, e.g., models, scoreboards, timers, splash screens, levels, rules, interactions, etc., should be factored out into a reusable game engine that generally supports those games that have some continuous movement (by either the player or the enemies), some goals that allow the player to advance through a series of levels, and a separate goal which causes the game to end.

At a high level, this software system

  * allows game designers (i.e., people with minimal programming skills) to create, deploy, and advertise new video games
  * allows users (i.e., people with no programming skills) to play, discuss, rate, and mod available games
